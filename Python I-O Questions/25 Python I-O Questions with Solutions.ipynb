    "25 Basic Python I/O Coding Questions along with Explanations for each.\n",
    "Let's get started â†“\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reading user input and printing it:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n",
    "print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: This code uses the `input()` function to read user input and then prints a greeting with the entered name.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Writing to a file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"output.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "    file.write(\"This is some text written to the file.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: This code opens a file named \"output.txt\" in write mode and writes the specified text into the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reading from a file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"input.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: This code reads the contents of a file named \"input.txt\" and prints the content on the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Appending to a file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"output.txt\", \"a\") as file:\n",
    "    file.write(\"\\nThis line is appended to the file.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: This code opens the \"output.txt\" file in append mode and adds a new line to the end of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Reading line by line from a file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"input.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    for line in file:\n",
    "        print(line.strip())\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: This code opens the \"input.txt\" file and reads its content line by line, printing each line without the newline character.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Using `sys.stdin` to read input:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "data = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n",
    "print(data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: This code reads a line of input from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()` and then prints the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Using `sys.stdout` to write output:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "sys.stdout.write(\"This is an output using sys.stdout.\\n\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: This code writes a string to the standard output using `sys.stdout.write()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Reading and parsing CSV file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import csv\n",
    "with open(\"data.csv\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    reader = csv.reader(file)\n",
    "    for row in reader:\n",
    "        print(row)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: This code reads a CSV file named \"data.csv\" and prints each row as a list of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Writing to a CSV file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import csv\n",
    "data = [[\"Name\", \"Age\"], [\"Alice\", 25], [\"Bob\", 30]]\n",
    "with open(\"output.csv\", \"w\", newline=\"\") as file:\n",
    "    writer = csv.writer(file)\n",
    "    writer.writerows(data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: This code writes a list of lists `data` to a CSV file named \"output.csv\".\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Reading JSON from a file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import json\n",
    "with open(\"data.json\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    data = json.load(file)\n",
    "    print(data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: This code reads a JSON file named \"data.json\" and loads its content into a Python data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Writing JSON to a file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import json\n",
    "data = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}\n",
    "with open(\"output.json\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "    json.dump(data, file)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: This code writes a Python dictionary `data` as JSON to a file named \"output.json\".\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Reading and writing binary data:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = b\"\\x48\\x65\\x6c\\x6c\\x6f\"\n",
    "with open(\"binary.bin\", \"wb\") as file:\n",
    "    file.write(data)\n",
    "with open(\"binary.bin\", \"rb\") as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: This code writes binary data to a file and then reads it back.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Using `pickle` for serialization:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pickle\n",
    "data = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}\n",
    "with open(\"data.pkl\", \"wb\") as file:\n",
    "    pickle.dump(data, file)\n",
    "with open(\"data.pkl\", \"rb\") as file:\n",
    "    loaded_data = pickle.load(file)\n",
    "    print(loaded_data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: This code uses the `pickle` module to serialize a Python dictionary and store it in a file. It then reads the pickled data back.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Formatting output using `str.format()`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "print(\"Name: {}, Age: {}\".format(name, age))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: This code uses the `str.format()` method to insert variables into the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. Using f-strings for formatted output (Python 3.6+):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "print(f\"Name: {name}, Age: {age}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: This code uses f-strings (formatted) to insert variables directly into the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Reading from standard input until EOF (End of File):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        line = input()\n",
    "        print(\"You entered:\", line)\n",
    "    except EOFError:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: This code continuously reads input from the user until it encounters the End of File (EOF) signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. Redirecting standard output to a file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "original_stdout = sys.stdout\n",
    "with open(\"output.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "    sys.stdout = file\n",
    "    print(\"This goes to the file.\")\n",
    "sys.stdout = original_stdout\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: This code temporarily redirects the standard output to a file, allowing all print statements to be written to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. Reading multiple values from a single input line:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = input(\"Enter name and age (separated by space): \")\n",
    "name, age = data.split()\n",
    "print(\"Name:\", name)\n",
    "print(\"Age:\", age)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: This code reads a line of input containing a name and an age (separated by a space), and then prints each value.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. Reading integers from multiple input lines:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = []\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        num = int(input(\"Enter an integer (or 'q' to quit): \"))\n",
    "        numbers.append(num)\n",
    "    except ValueError:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "print(\"You entered:\", numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: This code repeatedly reads integers from the user until the user enters 'q' to quit, then it prints all the entered integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. Reading a password without showing it on the screen:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import getpass\n",
    "password = getpass.getpass(\"Enter your password: \")\n",
    "print(\"Password entered.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: This code uses the `getpass` module to read a password from the user without showing it on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. Checking if a file exists before reading from it:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "file_path = \"data.txt\"\n",
    "if os.path.exists(file_path):\n",
    "    with open(file_path, \"r\") as file:\n",
    "        content = file.read()\n",
    "        print(content)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"File does not exist.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: This code checks if a file exists before attempting to read its content.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. Handling file not found error:\n",
    "```python\n",

    "    with open(file_path, \"r\") as file:\n",
    "        content = file.read()\n",
    "        print(content)\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    print(\"File not found.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: This code uses a try-except block to handle the case when the file is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "23. Writing formatted data to a file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}\n",
    "with open(\"output.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "    file.write(f\"Name: {data['name']}, Age: {data['age']}\\n\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: This code writes formatted data to a file using f-strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. Redirecting standard input from a file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "original_stdin = sys.stdin\n",
    "with open(\"input.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    sys.stdin = file\n",
    "    data = input()\n",
    "sys.stdin = original_stdin\n",
    "print(\"Data from file:\", data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: This code temporarily redirects the standard input to read from a file, allowing `input()` to read from the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. Handling file writing errors:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    with open(\"output.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "        file.write(\"Some data to write.\")\n",
    "except IOError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Error occurred while writing to the file:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: This code uses a try-except block to handle any errors that might occur during the file writing process."
