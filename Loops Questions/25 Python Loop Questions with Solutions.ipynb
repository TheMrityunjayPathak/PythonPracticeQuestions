    "```python\n",
    "for num in range(1, 11):\n",
    "    print(num)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: The `for` loop iterates over the `range(1, 11)` which generates numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive) and prints each number.\n",

    "        print(\"*\", end=\"\")\n",
    "    print()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: The outer `for` loop iterates from 0 to 4, and the inner `for` loop prints stars in increasing order for each iteration of the outer loop.\n",

    "    factorial *= num\n",
    "    num -= 1\n",
    "print(factorial)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: The `while` loop multiplies the `factorial` by `num` and decrements `num` by 1 until `num` becomes 0.\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    index = -1\n",
    "print(index)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: The `while` loop iterates through the `my_list` and checks if each element is equal to the `target`. If found, it breaks out of the loop, otherwise, it continues. The `else` block is executed if the loop completes without finding the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 using a `while` loop**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "num = 1\n",
    "sum_numbers = 0\n",

    "            break\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(num)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: The outer `for` loop iterates from 2 to 50, and the inner `for` loop\n",
    "checks for divisibility of `num` by numbers from 2 to `num - 1`. If it is divisible by any number, the inner loop is broken, otherwise, the `else` block is executed, and the number is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **Print numbers divisible by 3 or 5 from 1 to 20 using a `for` loop**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "    if num % 3 == 0 or num % 5 == 0:\n",
    "        print(num)\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "19. **Print the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th term using a `while` loop**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a, b = 0, 1\n",
